## Setup
1. Download DGTokenFarmerGithub.lua and utils.lua, place them in your Lua_Scripts folder   ![Path to folder](https://github.com/animoofps/ME-DGTokenFarmer/assets/144723877/cc4b571c-57e5-47d3-953f-49c52575d32d)

     **(For future Dead's utils updates visit [****Dead's utils****](https://me.deadcod.es/dead-utils) )**

3. Do this if you plan on using Max Guild! **(** Thank you violvte **)**: ![image](https://github.com/animoofps/ME-DGTokenFarmer/assets/144723877/a7414ddc-94c7-4466-952b-836b4d3223cc)                                                     

 4. **Update the local variables** :
- Set `foodName` to your desired food item.
- Set `foodAmount` to the amount of food you want to carry.
- Add your own `PIN` instead of the placeholder `1234`.

5. **Useful things to know** :
-  If you want to use something other than Necromancy check monstercheck2() and remove the conjures from it.
- Tune the portal to the Zamorakian Undercity, otherwise edit the script yourself (for now) so that you use the War's Retreat Teleport.
- Have your prefered loadout already loaded in, because we are utilizing load last preset here.
- Have **Eat Food** on the ability bar (![image](https://github.com/animoofps/ME-DGTokenFarmer/assets/144723877/7ffd0ab0-da20-45df-88fd-f69cdb5a791c)
