## Configuration

### User Settings (config.lua)

```lua
Config.UserInput = {
    -- Banking
    useBankPin = false,
    bankPin = 1234,

    -- Keybinds
    targetCycleKey = 0x09,  -- Tab key

    -- Health thresholds
    healthThreshold = {
        normal = {type = "percent", value = 50},
        critical = {type = "percent", value = 25},
        special = {type = "percent", value = 75}  -- Excalibur
    },

    -- Prayer thresholds
    prayerThreshold = {
        normal = {type = "current", value = 200},
        critical = {type = "percent", value = 10},
        special = {type = "current", value = 600}  -- Elven shard
    },

    -- Preset checks
    presetChecks = {
        {id = 48951, amount = 10},  -- Vuln bombs
        {id = 42267, amount = 8},   -- Blue blubbers
    }
}
```

### Buff Configuration

The script automatically manages these buffs:

- **Incense Sticks**: Smart potency management (max level 4)
- **Powder of Penance**: Prayer restoration buff
- **Scripture of Jas/Ful**: Pocket slot activation
- **Familiar Contracts**: Ripper demon/Hellhound summoning

### Rotation Customization

Edit rotation tables in `config.lua`:

```lua
Config.RotationManager = {
    fightRotation = {
        name = "Fight Rotation",
        rotation = {
            {label = "Ability Name", wait = 3, useTicks = true},
            {label = "Conditional Ability",
             condition = function() return API.GetAdrenalineFromInterface() > 60 end,
             replacementLabel = "Alternative"}
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands
