--- @module 'raksha.mechanics'
--- @version 1.0.0
--- Raksha mechanic detection and response.
---
--- Watches the boss's animation and fires the response defined in
--- raksha/constants.lua. Modelled on the Arch-Glacor approach (animation ->
--- mechanic -> behaviour) but kept as a standalone module so the fight loop can
--- call one `update()` and get a clear "did I take the game action this tick"
--- answer back.
---
--- Contract: `update()` returns true when it consumed the tick's action. The
--- caller must then skip its normal rotation for that tick, so a dodge and an
--- ability never contend for the same global cooldown.

--- Records that a mechanic's animation STARTED, whether or not we responded.
---
--- This is the honest version of "learn from our mistakes". A genuinely adaptive
--- system is the wrong tool for this fight: kills are short, the sample size per
--- session is tiny, and a wrong adaptation is fatal rather than merely slow —
--- you cannot A/B test a mechanic that one-shots you. What actually improves the
--- script is MEASUREMENT, because the numbers we're guessing at are knowable.
---
--- So we count two things per fight: how many times each mechanic's animation
--- fired, and how many times we actually began a response. The gap between them
--- is the miss rate, and it is the single most useful number here — a mechanic
--- showing seen=4 answered=2 is telling you exactly where the damage came from,
--- which is not something you can see by watching.

--      IS the arc — there's nothing in between to cut through.
--   2. It keeps us at a constant distance from Raksha, which phase 4 needs
--      anyway: drift out and he swaps tail sweeps for shadow bombs.
--

-- hug the ring, coarse enough that we aren't re-issuing a walk every tick.

--- Gets us out of Raksha's 7x7 tail sweep when we are NOT targeting him.

---      here — a bare Surge follows our facing, which while we're turned toward
---      an add is as likely to carry us across the sweep as out of it.
---   3. Walk, urgently. Slow, but it goes the right way.
---
--- Escape is deliberately absent: it moves away from our TARGET, and our target
--- is the add rather than Raksha, so it can just as easily throw us deeper in.

--- Picks the NEAREST pool, using cluster density only to break near-ties.
---
--- This used to be the other way round — densest cluster first, distance as the
--- tiebreak — on the reasoning that Threads of Fate splashes, so a knot of four
--- five tiles away beats an isolated pool two tiles away. That was right when
--- the rule was "clear to zero": every pool was going to die, so the only
--- question was what order killed them fastest.
---
--- It is wrong now. We clear down to the threshold and go back to Raksha, so we
--- kill a handful and leave — and the cost of a pool is dominated by the walk to
--- it, not the casts. Leading on a distant cluster meant crossing the arena
--- while the near pools we could have shaved off in seconds stayed up.
---
--- POOL_DISTANCE_TIE keeps the splash benefit where it is nearly free: pools
--- within a tile of each other in distance count as equally close, and the
--- denser of those wins.

--- O(n^2) in the pool count, so callers must only use it when they actually
--- need a new target — not on every pass.

--- pools linger while the boss isn't mid-animation, so the old animation-gated
--- handler never ran.
---
--- It attacks the chosen pool OBJECT DIRECTLY (DoAction_NPC__Direct), which
--- bypasses every id/name/type ambiguity by acting on the exact thing we found,
--- and leads with Threads of Fate so each cast takes three pools rather than
--- one. Movement (bomb/shadow dodge) runs first so we stay safe.

--- Once started we keep going until the count is back at or under the
--- threshold, then return to Raksha — the setting is a ceiling on how many pools
--- we tolerate, not an instruction to kill every one.

------------------------------------------

--- Called once per tick from the fight loop.
--- @return boolean consumed True if a mechanic used this tick's ability action
--- Priority order (highest first):
---   0. Dodge the shadow floor / insta-kill ground — ALWAYS, non-negotiable
---   1. Expel Shadow Energy
---   2. Freedom (bind + shadow bombardment)
---   3. Dodge bombs
---   4. Tail sweep (Escape when on the boss, else Surge)
---   5. Shadow manifestation
---   6. Shadow anima pools
---   7. The boss (rotation — we return false and the fight loop DPSes)
--- 5 and 6 own the fight outright while they're running: they cast from their
--- own ability lists and the fight loop holds the phase rotation for the whole
--- clear (see rotationOnHold), so nothing aimed at Raksha is spent on an add.
--- Phase 4 collapses most of this: we hold one tile east of Raksha so bombs and
--- bombardment never come out, pools are left alone (see killThresholdByPhase),
--- and the only thing that moves us is escaping the tail sweep — after which
--- returnHome puts us straight back on the tile.
--- Steps 2-4 are boss animations, so only one can be live at a time; their
--- relative `priority` decides which wins if a new animation starts while
--- another response is still running.
