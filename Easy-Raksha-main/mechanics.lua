--- @module 'raksha.mechanics'
--- @version 1.0.0
--- Raksha mechanic detection and response.
---
--- Watches the boss's animation and fires the response defined in
--- raksha/constants.lua. Modelled on the Arch-Glacor approach (animation ->
--- mechanic -> behaviour) but kept as a standalone module so the fight loop can
--- call one `update()` and get a clear "did I take the game action this tick"
--- answer back.
---
--- Contract: `update()` returns true when it consumed the tick's action. The
--- caller must then skip its normal rotation for that tick, so a dodge and an
--- ability never contend for the same global cooldown.

--- Records that a mechanic's animation STARTED, whether or not we responded.
---
--- This is the honest version of "learn from our mistakes". A genuinely adaptive
--- system is the wrong tool for this fight: kills are short, the sample size per
--- session is tiny, and a wrong adaptation is fatal rather than merely slow —
--- you cannot A/B test a mechanic that one-shots you. What actually improves the
--- script is MEASUREMENT, because the numbers we're guessing at are knowable.
---
--- So we count two things per fight: how many times each mechanic's animation
--- fired, and how many times we actually began a response. The gap between them
--- is the miss rate, and it is the single most useful number here — a mechanic
--- showing seen=4 answered=2 is telling you exactly where the damage came from,
--- which is not something you can see by watching.
