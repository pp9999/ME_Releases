---   P2 600k-400k  Energy waves start; he siphons, so pools must die
---   P3 400k-200k  8 pools per sweep and he siphons after EVERY special
---   P4 200k-0     Antechamber; shadow detonation dome

--- Phase 4 is a different, smaller arena and Raksha heals back to 400k on entry
--- — which reads as phase 3 on HP alone, so the phase is LATCHED and only ever
--- moves forward (see mechanics.getPhase).
---
--- Positioning there is relative to Raksha rather than a fixed tile: he can't be
--- walked through (a 7x7 block), the arena is tighter, and the whole phase is a
--- damage race against the detonation dome.

    -- tail sweep, and DPS.
    --
    -- We enter from the EAST and hold a single tile `homeOffsetX` east of him,

------------------------------------------

---
--- The arena is instanced so there are no fixed bounds to work from — the boss
--- itself is the anchor. Constraining every movement target to this radius keeps
--- us manoeuvring around the middle, where there is room to dodge the next
--- mechanic, and stops the safe-tile search from sending us to the edges.
---
--- Kept deliberately tight: the wiki calls for central positioning, and staying
--- close forces tail sweeps (dodgeable) instead of trampling charges and shadow
--- bombs. Drifting wide is what made the bot look lost.
Constants.ARENA_RADIUS = 8

--- Home tiles: the fixed spots we fight from and return to.
---
--- Anchoring movement to Raksha meant the anchor itself moved, so "stay within
--- N tiles" drifted with him and positioning was never repeatable. Instead we
--- record a home tile once per fight (the safespot, offset from the dormant
--- boss) and treat THAT as the centre — dodges move off it, and we walk back
--- once the danger clears. `alternateOffsetX` is the fallback spot to use when
--- the primary is sitting under a hazard.

-- # PHASE 4 MECHANIC OVERRIDES
------------------------------------------

--- Mechanics that behave differently in the final phase. Looked up first, with
--- Constants.MECHANICS as the fallback, so only the entries that actually differ
--- need repeating here.
---
--- Phase 4 is deliberately the simplest phase in the file: hold the east tile,
--- flick prayers against his autos, Escape both tail sweep variants, walk back,
--- and keep hitting him. Everything that used to relocate us around the arena
--- has been removed — the relocations themselves were what let him switch to
--- shadow bombs, so the fix for the bombs is to never leave the tile.
---
--- Both sweep variants therefore answer the same way: Escape out, reattack, and
--- let returnHome walk us back onto the spot. Bombs and bombardment need no
--- phase 4 entry at all — staying adjacent means they don't happen, and if one
--- does the general definitions still handle it.

--- Reference only; no thresholds are known yet, so nothing keys off this.
--- Bomb behaviour differs by phase:
---   Phase 1    single bomb, once per cycle
---   Phase 2-3  bombardment of 3-7 bombs, count scaling with anima absorbed
---   Phase 4    single bomb again, and only while outside melee distance
--- The dodge is the same either way, so the handler does not branch on phase.
--- What may need per-phase tuning is `duration`, since a bombardment of seven
--- bombs keeps the arena dangerous for longer than a single one.
