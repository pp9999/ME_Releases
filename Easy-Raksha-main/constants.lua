---   P3 400k-200k  8 pools per sweep and he siphons after EVERY special
---   P4 200k-0     Antechamber; shadow detonation dome
---
--- These are the BASE values. Constants.PHASE_HP is rebuilt from them by

--- Rescales the phase thresholds for a party of `size`.
---
--- Raksha's life points scale exactly with the party: 800,000 solo, 1,600,000
--- in a duo, and the wiki's strategy page confirms every transition doubles with
--- them — phases at 1.2M / 800k / 400k rather than 600k / 400k / 200k. The
--- enrage heal follows the same rule: he returns to phase 3's starting health,
--- which is 400k solo and 800k duo.
---
--- Getting this wrong is not a cosmetic reporting error. mechanics.getPhase
--- derives the phase from these numbers, and the phase decides which rotation is
--- loaded and which mechanic definitions apply — so a duo fight read against
--- solo thresholds sits in "phase 4" for most of the kill, loading the phase 4
--- rotation and its overrides against a boss still in phase 1.

--- mechanic, and stops the safe-tile search from sending us to the edges.

Constants.ARENA_RADIUS = 8

--- Home tiles: the fixed spots we fight from and return to.
---
--- Anchoring movement to Raksha meant the anchor itself moved, so "stay within
--- N tiles" drifted with him and positioning was never repeatable. Instead we
--- record a home tile once per fight (the safespot, offset from the dormant
--- boss) and treat THAT as the centre — dodges move off it, and we walk back
--- once the danger clears. `alternateOffsetX` is the fallback spot to use when

-- # MECHANIC DEFINITIONS
------------------------------------------

--- Tiles from Raksha we have to reach to be clear of the tail sweep, used by
--- both `escapeSweepWhenNotTargeting` and `walkFromBossWhenNotTargeting` so the
--- two routes can never disagree about what "out of it" means.
---
--- The sweep is a 7x7 centred on Raksha, so +/-3 tiles — but every distance here
--- is measured against his REPORTED tile (Tile_XYZ), and for a 5x5 NPC it is not
--- certain whether that is his centre or a corner. The rest of this file assumes
--- centre (PHASE4.homeOffsetX of 4 is described as "2 tiles off the edge of his
--- blocked 5x5", which only works from the centre), and on that reading 5 would
--- do. This is 7 because the cost of being wrong is asymmetric: two extra tiles
--- costs nothing — Necromancy reaches ~10, so we stay in range of the add we
--- were killing — while being two tiles short means eating a sweep that also
--- disables prayers. Tune down if the logs show us clearing it comfortably.
Constants.TAIL_SWEEP_CLEARANCE = 7

--- Clearance for PHASE 4 escapes, two tiles further out than everywhere else.
---
--- Phase 4 is the one phase we take the sweep from melee range: we hold the home
--- tile four out and the escape is a short hop, so any shortfall in it leaves us
--- inside. Observed in play — a Dive to the seven tile ring still got clipped.
---
--- Two tiles is also exactly the error the note above worries about. If the
--- reported tile is a CORNER of his 5x5 rather than the centre, a tile seven
--- from it can be barely five from where the sweep is really centred, and five
--- is not enough. Nine absorbs that either way.
---
--- Still inside Necromancy's ~10 tile reach, so the rotation keeps hitting him
--- from out here and the extra distance costs no damage. Left at 7 for phases
--- 1-3, where we are usually already off him on an add and moving further only
--- risks dropping the add out of range.
Constants.TAIL_SWEEP_CLEARANCE_P4 = 9

--- Tiles to retreat when a sweep answer's movement ability is on cooldown.
---
--- Escape has a long cooldown next to how often Raksha sweeps at melee range, so
--- "Escape is down" is the common case, not the rare one. It used to mean we did
--- not move AT ALL: runStep logged the ability as unavailable and the sequence
--- marched on to the reattack, so we stood in the 7x7 and wore it.
---
--- Five tiles, measured from where we STAND rather than from Raksha. Phase 4
--- holds a tile PHASE4.homeOffsetX (4) east of him, so five more puts us nine
--- out — which is TAIL_SWEEP_CLEARANCE_P4 exactly, and that agreement is
--- load-bearing rather than tidy. clearOfSweepRadius latches the "we are clear,
--- stop moving" flag at the phase 4 clearance, so a retreat that stopped short
--- of it would never satisfy the latch and we would shuffle in and out for the
--- rest of the animation. Change one of these two and change the other.
---
--- Still inside the phase 4 arenaRadius of 10, and within Necromancy's ~10 tile
--- reach so the rotation keeps hitting him on the way back in.
Constants.TAIL_SWEEP_FALLBACK_WALK = 5

--- How the fight loop should respond to each mechanic animation.
---
--- kind:
---   "instant"   fire once on the animation, then done
---   "sequence"  fire a list of abilities on consecutive ticks
---   "sustained" stay in a behaviour for a while after the animation
---
--- `retriggerAfter` guards against re-firing while the same animation is still
--- playing: the same mechanic will not trigger again within that many ticks.
--- Tail sweep note: it is a 7x7 AoE centred on Raksha, used when you are in
--- melee range, so clearing it means getting at least four tiles out. Escape and
--- Surge both cover that. It is typeless and disables prayers unless
--- Anticipation or Freedom is active first — 33707 already answers with
--- Freedom; 33706 answers with Escape alone, per observed usage, so it trades
--- the prayer-disable for a shorter, cheaper response. Adding a counter there is
--- an option if the prayer drop proves costly.

--- need repeating here.
---
--- Phase 4 is deliberately the simplest phase in the file: hold the east tile,
--- flick prayers against his autos, Escape both tail sweep variants, walk back,
--- and keep hitting him. Everything that used to relocate us around the arena
--- has been removed — the relocations themselves were what let him switch to
--- shadow bombs, so the fix for the bombs is to never leave the tile.
---
--- Both sweep variants therefore answer the same way: Escape out, reattack, and

--- does the general definitions still handle it.
