--- Raksha's drop table, from the wiki. IDs were read off each item's own wiki
--- page rather than copied across from another script, except where an id is
--- shared with rasial/main.lua and matched on re-check.
---
--- These lists only decide whether we bother OPENING the loot window: once it's
--- open, pickUpLoot presses Loot All, which takes everything in the pile. So a
--- drop missing from here is still collected as long as one listed item landed
--- alongside it — which the main table guarantees. That's why Raksha's head
--- isn't here: the wiki has no id for it (see Constants.PENDING), and it can't
--- be the only thing in a pile.
---
--- Items the wiki marks "(noted)" drop as bank notes. The wiki doesn't document
--- note ids, but a note always sits at base + 1, so both are listed — an id that
--- never appears on the ground costs nothing to scan for.

-- # BUFFS
------------------------------------------

--- Buffs kept up for the duration of the fight, in the format core/player_manager
--- expects. Ported from rasial/presets.lua:Presets.Buffs.
---
--- The contract is worth understanding, because it's what makes "on for the
--- fight, off after the kill" work without any explicit teardown:
---   * requestBuffs(BUFFS) is called every loop iteration WHILE Raksha is alive.
---   * Each frame the manager re-applies anything that has expired or been
---     stripped — which is what re-drinks the overload when the buff runs out.
---   * Entries marked `toggle` are tracked, and any toggle buff NOT requested on
---     a frame is toggled back off. So we simply stop requesting once he's dead
---     and Ruination and the pocket item switch themselves off. It retries until
---     it succeeds, unlike a one-shot teardown call.
---
--- Ruination is deliberately NOT in FIGHT_ROTATION as well. Casting it from both
--- places races the activation delay: the rotation turns it on, the manager sees
--- it as still-off a tick later, casts again, and toggles it straight back off.
--- Rasial has it buff-managed only, for the same reason.

-- Equipment container, and the pocket slot's index within it.

---
--- All three share one id between the item and the buff it grants, and all three
--- burn charges while active, so all three are toggles that must go off after the
--- kill. Only one can be in the pocket slot at a time, so every entry is gated on
--- finding its own item there: we can request all three unconditionally and
--- whichever is actually equipped is the only one that does anything. That's why
--- there's no setting for which one you're using.

-- are scripted here).

-- it still runs. There's deliberately no Improvise tail — once setup is done the
-- rotation simply ends and Revolution takes over. (Ruination and the overload are
-- handled by the player manager via BUFFS in both modes, not by the rotation.)

-- # PHASE 4 SPECIAL ACTION

--- The special action button that appears in phase 4.
---

--- single click going out. Player:getBuff reads the BUFF BAR only
--- (Buffbar_GetIDstatus), so if 45036 isn't a buff-bar entry — it may live on the
--- debuff bar, or not be a bar entry at all — that gate never opens.
---
--- So the button itself is now the trigger. Interface 743 is the shared
--- special-action container (Kerapac's "Warp time" button reads out of the same
--- place), and we scan it for button text. That's the precise signal: it goes
--- false the moment the button is consumed, which also answers the original
--- worry about the buff outliving the button.
---
--- The buff is kept only as a FALLBACK for the case where the scan can't see
--- Raksha's button either. Once the scan has proven itself even once we stop
--- consulting the buff at all, because the scan is strictly better.
---
--- Either way a click cap plus pacing applies, so no signal — stuck true, or
--- lingering after the button is gone — can turn into a click loop.

--
-- "Ticks" is load-bearing here. The "Handle fight" task is `parallel` with

--
-- Two windows, because a bad read and a real kill look identical for a moment:
-- when he was last seen nearly dead a short confirmation is trustworthy, but

---
--- Animation 33707 does double duty, which is the whole subtlety:
---   * In phases 1-3 it is the tail sweep we answer with Freedom.
---   * At 200k HP or below it is the phase 4 transition.
---
--- HP alone cannot separate them. Phase 4 itself runs 400k down to 0 and he tail
--- sweeps the whole way through, so at 150k in phase 4 a 33707 is a real sweep
--- that MUST get its Freedom — treating that as a transition would freeze us
--- standing in it. The latch is what disambiguates: the transition happens
--- exactly once, before the phase 4 rotation is loaded, so once loadedPhase
--- reaches 4 this can only ever be a sweep.
---
--- Holding through it matters for two reasons. The obvious one is that abilities
--- sent during the transition are swallowed. The damaging one is that
--- PHASE4_ROTATION was being loaded the instant HP crossed 200k — mid-transition
--- — and the rotation manager walks each step's `wait` down on its own schedule
--- whether or not the ability landed, so the Adrenaline renewal / Living Death /
--- Death Skulls opener was spent against a locked player and we arrived in phase
--- 4 already parked on the Improvise tail.
