--- Every dose of every potion the rotation will accept for its adrenaline beat.
---
--- Both potions are carried in one list rather than picked between, because the
--- places that care — the bank check in LOADOUT and adrenalinePotion()'s "have
--- we got one" guard — can each take the whole list and ask "any of these".
--- Nothing has to know WHICH one you brought.
---
--- ORDER IS PREFERENCE, and it still drives the drink. API.GetAB_ids matches the
--- action bar against these ids in the order given, so a bag holding both drinks
--- the renewal and keeps the replenishment. Swap the two blocks to reverse that.
---
--- Note the two are not equivalent, only interchangeable: they restore different
--- amounts of adrenaline, and PHASE2_ROTATION's beat after the drink is written
--- around the renewal's refund. See adrenalinePotion().

--- LOADOUT is a CHECKLIST, not the thing that fills your bag.
---
--- Worth being explicit, because it is easy to read the other way round:
--- core/wars_retreat loads supplies with Interact:Object(bank, "Load Last Preset
--- from"), i.e. your IN-GAME preset. This table only drives two things —
--- Utils:inventoryMatchCheck, which decides whether we need to re-bank, and the
--- startup warnings about missing items.
---
--- Which makes a WRONG id here actively dangerous rather than merely useless:
--- inventoryMatchCheck fails if any single entry is unsatisfied, that keeps
--- sending us back to the bank, and loadLastPreset terminates the script on the
--- third failed attempt. Only put ids in here that you have actually confirmed.
---
--- TODO: Super restore FLASKS. They belong in this list so that running out
--- triggers a re-bank, but the flask ids are not in this codebase anywhere and
--- are NOT the same as the plain potion's {3024, 3026, 3028, 3030}. Add them as
--- an `ids` entry once confirmed. Nothing else needs changing for them to be
--- drunk: core/player_manager's "prayer" category matches on the name pattern
--- "Super restore", which "Super restore flask (6)" satisfies already.

-- # ITEM ACTIVATION (ACTION BAR)
------------------------------------------

-- EVERY item this script activates goes through one of the two functions below —
-- useBarItem for fixed-name items (the Vulnerability bomb, the familiar pouch,
-- the gear switches) and useBarPotion for anything with doses (the overload, the
-- adrenaline potions, the spiritual prayer potion). The split is not cosmetic:
-- see useBarPotion for why a name lookup silently fails on a potion.
--
-- The inventory calls they replaced (Inventory:DoAction, DoAction_Inventory1/2/3,
-- Inventory:Equip, and the rotation manager's `type = "Inventory"`) are all gone
-- from this file.
--
-- THE PREREQUISITE, because there is no way for the script to fix it: the item
-- has to be ON the action bar. API.DoAction_Ability resolves by name against the
-- bar, so an item that is in the bag but not barred simply cannot be used this
-- way. That is why a miss is logged loudly — an unbarred item otherwise fails in
-- complete silence, and a script that quietly stops overloading looks like a
-- dozen other problems before it looks like this one.
--
-- Inventory READS are untouched: Inventory:Contains / GetItem still gate every
-- caller. Those answer "do we have one", which the bar cannot tell us and which
-- is worth knowing separately from "can we press it".

--- Names we've already warned about, so a missing bar entry logs once rather
--- than on every attempt. Keyed by item name.

--- Uses a multi-dose POTION from the action bar, matched by ICON ID.

--- never matches a barred potion, the press silently does nothing, and the only
--- symptom is a potion that is never drunk.
---
--- API.GetAB_ids exists for exactly this case: api.lua documents it as matching
--- bar slots by icon id "in order of input, for potions ... full dose to
--- smaller". It hands back the slot, which DoAction_Ability_Direct presses.

-- # BUFFS
------------------------------------------

--- Buffs kept up for the duration of the fight, in the format core/player_manager
--- expects. Ported from rasial/presets.lua:Presets.Buffs.
---
--- The contract is worth understanding, because it's what makes "on for the
--- fight, off after the kill" work without any explicit teardown:
---   * requestBuffs(BUFFS) is called every loop iteration WHILE Raksha is alive.
---   * Each frame the manager re-applies anything that has expired or been
---     stripped — which is what re-drinks the overload when the buff runs out.
---   * Entries marked `toggle` are tracked, and any toggle buff NOT requested on
---     a frame is toggled back off. So we simply stop requesting once he's dead
---     and Ruination and the pocket item switch themselves off. It retries until
---     it succeeds, unlike a one-shot teardown call.
---
--- Ruination is deliberately NOT in FIGHT_ROTATION as well. Casting it from both
--- places races the activation delay: the rotation turns it on, the manager sees
--- it as still-off a tick later, casts again, and toggles it straight back off.
--- Rasial has it buff-managed only, for the same reason.

---
--- 5 was the soul CAP (three by default, five while a soulbound lantern is

--- was the casts themselves. Soul Sap is the only generator in these rotations

--- first Volley and three at its second: BOTH failed the gate and fell through
--- to Soul Sap, every kill, and `replacementLabel` meant that never showed up as
--- anything going wrong. The gate wasn't wrong in principle, it was simply set
--- above what the rotation delivers.
---
--- 3 is the default cap and the figure the sibling Arch-Glacor rotations in this
--- repo already use. It clears every Volley site here except the immediate
--- second of a back-to-back pair, which nothing can save: the first Volley
--- empties the bar and one Soul Sap cannot refill it. Those keep falling through

--- not branch on which: it hands the whole id list to the client and the first
--- one present is clicked. Bring either, bring both, bring any dose.
---
--- What you bring is NOT neutral, though. This step exists to fund the beat
--- below it in PHASE2_ROTATION, and that beat is written around the renewal's
--- refund. A replenishment restoring less adrenaline still drinks correctly and
--- still leaves the fight in a sane state — Death Skulls simply waits for the
--- bar rather than firing off the refund — but the phase runs a little slower
--- for it. Worth knowing before blaming the rotation.
---
--- Two things matter here and both were wrong before:
---
--- ORDER. Rasial drinks it immediately AFTER Living Death, not before, and
--- that's the whole point of the guide writing them as one beat ("Living death +
--- Adrenaline renewal"): Living Death spends the full 100, the renewal refunds
--- the bar, and the Death Skulls and double Finger of Death that follow are paid
--- for out of the refund. Drinking first meant that on entering the phase near
--- capped the `< 100` guard skipped the potion, Living Death then emptied the
--- bar, and nothing ever refilled it — so the potion went undrunk for the whole
--- kill and the Fingers fell through to their Touch of Death replacement.
---
--- DON'T-DRINK. The player manager drinks prayer potions on its own schedule
--- out of manageHealth/managePrayer, which runs in the same tick as the
--- rotation. Rasial pauses it around the renewal; we do the same, but against
--- the manager we're actually running — Rasial calls

-- # PHASE 4 SPECIAL ACTION
------------------------------------------

--- The special action button that appears in phase 4.
---

--- single click going out. Player:getBuff reads the BUFF BAR only
--- (Buffbar_GetIDstatus), so if 45036 isn't a buff-bar entry — it may live on the
--- debuff bar, or not be a bar entry at all — that gate never opens.
---
--- So the button itself is now the trigger. Interface 743 is the shared
--- special-action container (Kerapac's "Warp time" button reads out of the same
--- place), and we scan it for button text. That's the precise signal: it goes
--- false the moment the button is consumed, which also answers the original
--- worry about the buff outliving the button.
---
--- The buff is kept only as a FALLBACK for the case where the scan can't see
--- Raksha's button either. Once the scan has proven itself even once we stop
--- consulting the buff at all, because the scan is strictly better.
---
--- Either way a click cap plus pacing applies, so no signal — stuck true, or
--- lingering after the button is gone — can turn into a click loop.

--- the transition ran exactly as badly as before.
---
--- Animation 33707 does double duty, which is the whole subtlety:
---   * In phases 1-3 it is the tail sweep we answer with Freedom.
---   * At 200k HP or below it is the phase 4 transition.
---
--- HP alone cannot separate them. Phase 4 itself runs 400k down to 0 and he tail
--- sweeps the whole way through, so at 150k in phase 4 a 33707 is a real sweep
--- that MUST get its Freedom — treating that as a transition would freeze us
--- standing in it. The latch is what disambiguates: the transition happens
--- exactly once, before the phase 4 rotation is loaded, so once loadedPhase
--- reaches 4 this can only ever be a sweep.
---
--- Holding through it matters for two reasons. The obvious one is that abilities
--- sent during the transition are swallowed. The damaging one is that
--- PHASE4_ROTATION was being loaded the instant HP crossed 200k — mid-transition
--- — and the rotation manager walks each step's `wait` down on its own schedule
--- whether or not the ability landed, so the Adrenaline renewal / Living Death /
--- Death Skulls opener was spent against a locked player and we arrived in phase
--- 4 already parked on the Improvise tail.
--- The animation ending is NOT the end of the transition — we're still locked for
--- a moment afterwards, which is why the first few phase 4 abilities were being
--- thrown away. So the hold runs on for this many ticks after 33707 stops.

--- number only works when nothing else is flagged in the other byte, so it was
--- always fragile — any change to what else counts as blocking silently breaks
--- it, and nothing else in the codebase reads 2874 that way.

--- Consecutive bad samples before we accept the read is genuinely broken.
---

--- lobby over a single frame of that would be worse than the bug.

--- Slots a healthy inventory read reports. Always 28.
local INVENTORY_SLOTS = 28

--- Whether the client's inventory array is currently unusable.
---
--- TWO signals, because one was not enough. Inventory:IsArrayNull() reads like
--- the whole answer — its own documentation says "null or unexpected size" — but
--- a watchdog built on it alone never fired once while the client was logging
--- "Unexpected inventory size" on every frame. Whatever that message is raised
--- from, IsArrayNull does not agree with it.
---
--- So the slot count is asked directly as well. A healthy read has 28 entries;
--- anything else IS the fault, by definition, and needs no interpretation.
---
--- ReadInvArrays33 is a native call, which is why this runs on the watchdog's
--- tick cadence and never per frame.
--- AMBIGUITY MEANS HEALTHY. Anything this cannot measure is reported as fine.
---
--- That rule is written in blood. The first version treated "could not measure
--- it" as a fault, via `type(slots) ~= "table"` — and ReadInvArrays33 does not
--- return a Lua table. Every caller in this repo iterates it with ipairs and
--- none of them ever calls type() or #, which is the signature of a userdata
--- binding: ipairs-able through metamethods, but `type()` says "userdata".
---
--- So that check was true on EVERY call, healthy or not. The watchdog fired
--- continuously at War's Retreat, forced a preset reload every fifteen ticks,
--- pinned the step machine on LOAD PRESET and stopped the script ever reaching
--- the portal. A watchdog that acts on "I don't know" is worse than no watchdog.
---
--- The count is therefore taken by ITERATING, which works on a table and on an
--- ipairs-able userdata alike, and a failure to count reports healthy.

--- runs at least once per tick.
---

--- next). A jump of 2 or more means one pass of the loop took longer than a
--- whole game tick and we SKIPPED one: every mechanic that started and ended

--- It is a HUMAN-READABLE DIAGNOSTIC — nobody can read a table that updates 60

--- follows and is ~1/20th of the scanning.

--- "Detected:" block that runs five object scans — findAnyType for 2789, 27355,
--- 27356 and 27354, plus getShadowTiles — and findAnyType asks for EIGHT object
--- types at once (mechanics.lua:270), three of them at range 60. buildGUIData
--- called it unconditionally on every RENDERED FRAME, on ImGui's thread. At 60
--- fps that is ~300 native object-array scans a second, all of them competing
--- with the fight loop for the same client, purely to fill a debug table.
---
--- Two gates now. The tab that displays these rows only exists when the
--- mechanics debug flag is on (raksha/gui.lua:1154), so with it off the rows
--- were being computed and then thrown away entirely — that path now does no
--- work at all. With it on, the rebuild is throttled to TRACKING_INTERVAL and
--- the last table is handed back in between.
---
--- CONFIG.debug.mechanics, NOT CONFIG.debugMechanics: getConfig() reshapes the
--- flat GUI table into a nested runtime one (raksha/gui.lua:475-483), so the
--- flat name the checkbox and the tab check use does not exist on CONFIG. Gating
--- on the wrong name here would read nil and silently disable the tab for
--- everyone.
